✅ Updated GPO DAO Prompt — With Full Web3 + IPFS + Gas Optional Flow

🏗️ Project: GPO DAO — Fully Decentralized Governance & Company Formation Platform

GPO DAO is a Web3-native platform for company formation, shareholder governance, decentralized voting, treasury management, and on-chain business operations, designed for global digital companies & investor groups.

The platform enables companies to:

Register a company entity (on-chain or via service partners)

Issue equity tokens for shareholders

Perform governance using Snapshot

Store corporate documents & data on IPFS / Filecoin

Manage treasury via Safe multi-sig

Support optional gasless UX or pay-per-gas model

Never rely on centralized storage or backend servers


This ensures zero custody, zero user-data storage, and no operator lock-in — even if the platform disappears, the DAO continues operating.

✅ Request to Lovable

Please rebuild the platform based on this updated architecture.

Focus on:

Wallet-only auth (no Supabase)

Share tokens = equity

Snapshot governance auto-setup

IPFS document storage

Gnosis Safe per-company treasury

Gas optional (Biconomy toggle)

$1 flat protocol fee


This replaces the previous Supabase-centric SaaS model.

> Output should remain modular & open-source — users own data, not the platform.
